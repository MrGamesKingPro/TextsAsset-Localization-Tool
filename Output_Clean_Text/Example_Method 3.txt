"Part-time worker"
"We saw each other earlier, right? Are you going to Jayhyeon? You must be a trainee!!"
"Part-time worker"
"But... you should be careful on the streets tonight."
"Part-time worker"
"Since earlier, there's been a man in a hoodie just staring at the Jayhyeon building from over there."
"Part-time worker"
"The atmosphere seems a bit creepy..."
"Part-time worker"
"Welcome~"
"Part-time worker"
"By any chance... are you Jiwoo herself? No wonder... you're wearing the same outfit as Jiwoo!! I just realized now!"
"Part-time worker"
"I overheard your conversation in front of the convenience store yesterday, I was quite surprised."
"Part-time worker"
"But that person... be careful, they come here sometimes, and their eyes look kind of scary..."
"Part-time worker"
"It feels like they might cause some trouble..."
"Player"
"What room... I'll just put it here."
"Player"
"But the doll is pretty."
"Player"
"By the way, I had a practice room schedule this evening, right?"

"I should listen to the new album title track a bit more before going."
"Player"
"The song seems to have turned out well this time, I should prepare well...!!"
"Player"
"I'm tired even though I didn't do anything."
"Player"
"What kind of package came like this... Let me open it."
"Short-haired man"
"Oh, mom."
"Short-haired man"
"No, I'm at the study room now. I was studying."
"Short-haired man"
"Oh, what stalker again... I said it's not. Just... I'm a bit tired these days. Don't worry about it."
"Short-haired man"
"I'm preparing for job hunting well. I go to the study room every day and work hard, so stop worrying. Yeah."
"Short-haired man"
"I said I'm not outside!!! Oh, I have to be quiet in the study room, hang up."
"Player"
"Excuse me, is there a reason you keep staring like that?"
"Man"
"Oh, I'm sorry. I was being rude. It's just... you look like Jiwoo."
"Player"
"Yes, that's right. Are you a fan by any chance?"
"Man"
"Oh, no. I was just curious... Have a good day!"
"Security guard"
"Wait a moment. I'm sorry, but that area is currently under access control."
"Security guard"
"The entire elevator is under emergency inspection until this morning."
"Security guard"
"Excuse me... I'm sorry..."
"Security guard"
"There will be a building-wide inspection shortly."
"Security guard"
"I think you should get up now."
"Security guard"
"I am a security guard belonging to Jayhyeon Entertainment's security team."
"Man with hat"
"...."
"Man"
"Excuse me.."
"Man"
"By any chance, are you Jiwoo?"
"Oh... yes, that's right!"
"I think you're mistaken."
"Man"
"Oh.. It's an honor!"
"Man"
"I'm a fan of Jiwoo."
"Man"
"So you came to the agency today for practice?"
"Because album preparation is in full swing.."
"I just came to have coffee for a break."
"Man"
"Come on, no matter how you look at it, it's Jiwoo."
"Man"
"Don't worry, I'm not that kind of person!"
"Man"
"I'm a fan of Jiwoo."
"Man"
"So you came to the agency today for practice?"
"Because album preparation is in full swing.."
"I just came to have coffee for a break."
"Man"
"Right, I'm looking forward to it!!"
"Man"
"Jiwoo's songs always exceed expectations..."
"Man"
"But there must be many people watching.."
"Man"
"Do you usually come often at this time?"
"Man"
"I'm not trying to find you or anything, just..."
"Not often but... it's a busy time."
"I'm sorry, I'll be going now."
"Man"
"Rest is good... Don't overwork yourself."
"Man"
"But there must be many people watching.."
"Man"
"Do you usually come often at this time?"
"Man"

"Man"
"That's right, fighting!"
"Man"
"I hope we meet again!"
"Player"
"I slept well."
"Player"
"Let's start today"
"Player"
"What is that guy doing...?"
"Player"
"Isn't he following too obviously?"
"Player"
"This is why evening practice is stressful."
"Player"
"Should I ask the security guard to stay 24 hours.."
"Player"
"Sigh, anyway... Let's just practice about 2 songs and go."
"Player"
"Album preparation is important."
"Player"
"Sigh... What should I do? Mom doesn't know anything"
"Player"
"The police can't help either, and because I'm an idol, they just think I'm being dramatic...?"
"Player"
"Do I have to handle everything alone like this?"
"Player"
"I need to meet mom tomorrow and talk about what to do."
"Mom"
"Hello?"
"Player"
"Mom, something really scary just happened to me..."
"Mom"
"Huh? What happened? Are you okay?"
"Player"
"Yeah... I came to the agency for practice, but someone was staring at me in the bathroom..."
"Mom"
"Huh? The agency?"
"Player"
"Yeah... it was on the 1st floor, I couldn't see clearly but it was some man.."
"Mom"
"For now, go home and rest today, let's meet at that cafe tomorrow and talk."
"Police"
"Yes~ Hello. This is the police."
"Player"
"Um... this is Jiwoo! Can you come to Jayhyeon Entertainment right now?"
"Police"
"Yes? Jiwoo? Ah... you mean the idol Jiwoo?"
"Player"
"Yes! That Jayhyeon Entertainment female idol Jiwoo is correct..."
"Player"
"Just now someone was peeking at me in the bathroom here..."
"Police"
"Ah... yes. But where are you currently located?"
"Police"
"And do you have specific damage details and evidence?"
"Police"
"From report reception... we have so many idol personal stalking cases right now."
"Player"
"Evidence? I just saw it with my own eyes right now? You don't believe what I'm saying?"
"Police"
"We're not unaware of the situation but... to dispatch to the scene, we need clear evidence."
"Police"
"Like CCTV footage, recording content, things like that for stalking evidence."
"Player"
"Ha... that's it. You can't even help... hang up!"
"Player"
"Good.."
"Player"
"Should we call it a day today?"
"Player"
"Ah..."
"Player"
"My stomach hurts..."
"Player"
"Why is this happening when I'm only eating salad for album preparation."
"Player"
"I don't usually use the agency bathroom, but I have no choice but to stop by.."
"Player"
"What is it... what is that guy doing..? Just now... ha"
"Player"
"What should I do..? Who should I call right now...."
"Player"
"What is it..."
"Player"
"Did the manager change their number??"
"Player"
"Why didn't they tell me.."
"Player"
"Let's practice a bit more."
"Player"
"I should do at least 2 songs every day!"
"Short-haired man"
"Gasp...!!!!"
"Short-haired man"
"Um... you're Jiwoo, right? My goodness... meeting here of all places. No schedule today?"
"You're mistaken."
"Ah... yes. Just some personal matters."
"Short-haired man"
"Come on, I can tell at a glance."
"Short-haired man"
"Don't worry, there's no one here but me!!"
"Short-haired man"
"Aren't you overworking yourself lately? Only eating salad every day at the dorm..."
"Short-haired man"
"You'll really collapse like that. Do you know how worried the fans are?"
"Well... I have to diet for album preparation..."
"How do you know I only eat salad?"
"Short-haired man"
"Aren't you overworking yourself lately? Only eating salad every day at the dorm..."
"Short-haired man"
"You'll really collapse like that. Do you know how worried the fans are?"
"Well... I have to diet for album preparation..."
"How do you know I only eat salad?"
"Short-haired man"
"Hehe, right right~"
"Short-haired man"
"But... even though you're on a diet,"
"Short-haired man"
"Your face looks very tired lately. Not like Jiwoo..."
"Short-haired man"
"There's nothing else difficult going on, right?"
"....It's always tiring"
"I'm fine, thank you for worrying about me."
"Short-haired man"
"Well, you've been like that every time during album preparation."
"Short-haired man"
"What's so new about it..hehe"
"Short-haired man"
"But... even though you're on a diet,"
"Short-haired man"
"Your face looks very tired lately. Not like Jiwoo..."
"Short-haired man"
"There's nothing else difficult going on, right?"
"....It's always tiring"
"I'm fine, thank you for worrying about me."
"Short-haired man"
"I know it's not easy."
"Short-haired man"
"That house... it's too big and scary to be alone in, right?"
"Short-haired man"
"Stay strong. We fans are always watching over you."
"Short-haired man"
"Come on, as a fan, this level of worry is... natural."
"Short-haired man"
"That house... it's too big and scary to be alone in, right?"
"Short-haired man"
"Stay strong. We fans are always watching over you."
"Cafe part-time worker"
"Welcome~"
"Cafe part-time worker"
"Um... you're Jiwoo, right?"
"Cafe part-time worker"
"Drink... I'll prepare your usual order~"
"Player"
"Hmm..? What is this card."
"Player"
"Name... Kim Heon-wook? And it says Jayhyeon Entertainment? Is that person perhaps a company employee...?"
"Player"
"If it's the security team, it's on the 3rd floor..."
"Player"
"Why was a security team employee following me around and secretly eavesdropping?"
"Player"
"An in-house stalker...?"
"Man"
"Excuse me.."
"Man"
"I live nearby, and last night while walking, I saw a suspicious person running out."
"Man"
"I took some photos just in case.."
"Man"
"You're okay, right? You seemed like something scary happened to you yesterday..."
"Man"
"Would you like to take a look?"
"Mom"
"Our daughter, did you sleep well? Did you take the medicine from the fridge? Your face doesn't look good."
"Player"
"Mom! I was secretly filmed in the bathroom yesterday. I think it was that stalker I often see, but I'm not sure..."
"Mom"
"Secret filming? You're not being overly sensitive again, are you? Did you tell the police?"
"Player"
"I did! But they don't believe me because there's no evidence! What should I do, mom..."
"Mom"
"Our daughter. Mom understands everything. How hard it must be for you these days. It's okay, it's okay."
"Player"
"Mom believes what I say, right? No one knows how hard it is for me right now... everyone just says I'm too sensitive..."
"Mom"
"Our daughter... did you sleep well?"
"Mom"
"Did you take the medicine from the fridge? Your face doesn't look good."
"Mom"
"So what about yesterday? Someone was peeking at you?"
"Exactly as I said.."
"Mom"
"By any chance... you're not being overly sensitive again, are you?"
"Mom"
"Last time there was a similar incident but it turned out to be nothing."
"Mom"
"Did you check the CCTV?"
"You're doubting me again? I'm the victim here?"
"Where would there be CCTV in the bathroom.."
"Mom"
"That's not it. We're just trying to confirm for sure.."
"Mom"
"So... the medicine? Are you taking it properly?"
"Mom"
"I said you need to take it consistently to get better.."
"I said I'm not sick.."
"Mom"
"Oh, it was in the bathroom, right.. I got confused."
"Mom"
"So... the medicine? Are you taking it properly?"
"Mom"
"I said you need to take it consistently to get better.."
"I said I'm not sick.."
"Player"
"Huh...? This person was following me yesterday..."
"Player"
"The face looks different from what I saw in the bathroom..."
"Player"
"Can I take this photo for now? I need to submit it to the police!"
"Man"
"Yes, of course... I hope it helps."
"Player"
"It was a terrible day."
"Player"
"Couldn't even sleep properly..."
"Player"
"Let's go meet mom."
"Fan1"
"Wow... it's really Jiwoo. You're so much prettier than on screen!!"
"Fan1"
"I'm 'Hyunwoo'! I'm always cheering for you!"
"Fan1"
"Can you write 'Hyunwoo, may you be filled with only happy things'? I'll treasure it!"
"Short-haired man"
"Lately... you look very tired. On stage too, and now too."
"Short-haired man"
"Not like Jiwoo."
"Short-haired man"
"Please write this on paper. 'Thank you for always watching over me'"
"Fan3"
"Jiwoo... Jiwoo's voice and songs... I'm really a fan!!"
"Fan3"
"Instead of my name... please write the name of the shampoo Jiwoo likes best."
"Fan3"
"No particular reason.."
"Fan3"
"I just want to have the same scent as Jiwoo."
"Man with hat"
"Please write 'Jayhyeon Apartment 7701'.."
"Man with hat"
"It's the apartment I really want to live in..."
"Man with hat"
"I like the room number too.."
"Give autograph"
"Refuse"
"Man with hat"
"Why...?"
"Man with hat"
"Why won't you do it for me?"
"Man with hat"
"Why!!!"
"Man with hat"
"You're ignoring only me..??"
"Man with hat"
"You did it for everyone else..?!!!!"
"Man with hat"
"You're just like everyone else in the end..."
"Man with hat"
"The bastards who look down on me....."
"Player"
"Ha... that stalker last night... I almost died."
"Player"
"Couldn't sleep well so I'm groggy."
"Player"
"Anyway, this is like being on stage. Let's focus and finish quickly."
"Player"
"That stalker, he won't come today too...?"
"Player"
"If he shows up again, I'll gather proper evidence and definitely go to the police station next time..."
"Player"
"I want to rest but the next album is only a few days away..."
"Player"
"Let's practice hard today too!"
"Player"
"......"
"Player"
"The doll's direction... seems to have changed."
"Player"
"Is it just my imagination..."
"Something feels creepy.."
"Who is it.. Let's just pretend I'm not here."
"Just go away.. There's someone inside..."
"....That short-haired guy... What again, what are you staring at like that.."
"There must be something that could be evidence in that guy's place.."
"What should I do...? Should I hide?"
"Or is there something like... wine bottle that could defeat that "fake"..?"
"....It's over, right? Let's go home quickly..."
"It's been a while since the comeback... Come on, let's do our best!"
"Player"
"Finally... you finally came to save me...!"
"Player"
"That woman... suddenly came in and attacked me!"
"Player"
"Quickly... quickly arrest that woman!"
"Police"
"I'm arresting you as a suspect. You have the right to an attorney..."
"Player"
"What? Me? Why? I'm the victim! I'm the 'real' Jiwoo!"
"Player"
"And... that man! That man is also a stalker. He secretly filmed me..."
"Police"
"This person is a private investigator hired by Jayhyeon Entertainment."
"Police"
"Thanks to him, we got great help investigating meticulous and vicious... sasaeng fans like you."
"Police"
"That's enough now, get a grip."
"Police"
"We know all about the crime you planned long ago. All evidence has been secured."
"Player"
"Whew~ today was busy too."
"Player"
"Indeed, the life of an idol... is enjoyable."
"Player"
"This is truly... the life I dreamed of as the 'real Jiwoo'..."
"Player"
"Whew... I'm finally calming down. It was such a scary dream..."
"Player"
"By the way... that guy's face in the dream... it overlaps with the guy who was chasing me last night..."
"Player"
"Why doesn't anyone believe what I say."
"Player"
"The police say there's no evidence, and the manager oppa shows as a non-existent number..."
"Player"
"I think I need to go to the police station directly tomorrow. I can't just stay still."
"Player"
"Gasp, gasp, gasp...!"
"Player"
"Just now... definitely... that stalker....?"
"Player"
"It was... a dream."
"Player"
"My whole body is soaked in cold sweat..."
"Player"
"Terrible. I need to quickly... wash away this bad feeling."
